My nephew's nephew Jacques Eyoum Madiba answered this question with his usual care: "" elections in Cameroon is closely linked to the migration movements of which the periods are known. These migration movements fixed each other at a specific location and preceded the settlement. Thus, every tribe is indigenous where white people found it and any idea contrary to it is simple math.

Finally, thank you to Joseph Antoine Bell who broke the nail: "" One word, about a political issue of the hour in Cameroon: how can we scream at the scandal today against a law that will remove the posts at the head of the communities local, after accepting and defending for almost 60 years the principle of regional balance, including in the administration contests?
How can we explain why some did not see the charge of discrimination when English speakers were given the right to run their business and not to the rest of the regions?

"Cameroon, February 2008-29, 25, the draft constitutional modification to allow president paul biya to remain in power leads to a bloody repression in camera of "" Apprentice Wizards ü§î ü§î

Modification of article 6, article 2 of the 1996 Constitution, which limits to two terms the possibility for a president of the republic to remain in power on a continuous basis.

Following the call for the strike of the main carrier s' unions against rising fuel prices, many young people - driven by the perspective of extension of the bad governance of the existing regime - took over the streets of the main cities From South Cameroon on February 2008, 25, with socio-economic, civic and political claims. In the face of the scale of the social movement, transformed into riots with the first death by bullet, the authorities have decided to deploy in numbers of military members on the ground with disproportionate means to contain people, certainly furious, but with their bare hands.

"" the defence and security forces went to bloody repression for four days, with excessive use of deadly force, causing the death of at least 139 people according to the National Human Rights Observatory [2 ], including several extra-court performances "" reminds cl√©ment boursin, responsible Africa at the 40 dead according to the authorities including a police officer. Nearly 3 young people, considered to be ""Wizards Apprentice"", have been arrested. Many of them have been ill-treated and even tortured during their arrest and arrest.

From Massacre in camera to silent impunity
These events went relatively unnoticed on the international media scene. In the face of the self-indulgent silence of the international community and the lack of pressure, the cameroonian authorities have not carried out any independent and impartially investigation to establish the truth about these four days of violence. "" no part of the security forces believed to have committed serious human rights violations has been the subject of penalties or judicial action in ten years says cl√©ment boursin, Africa manager at the

For several years, various united nations bodies (Human Rights Council, committee against torture, human rights committee) have been concerned about this impunity. The Cameroonian authorities have, each time, claimed that the law forces had been acting in a state of "" Self-Defence "" in the face of people who had "" acquired weapons of war by attacking police and gendarmerie units ""[ 3]. although requested several times, the administrative report of the cameroonian authorities on the subject has never been sent to the united nations or made public.

A new repression that turns into a low intensity conflict
The same repression took place, from October 2016 and for more than a year, on young cameroonian speakers who walked peacefully against the ""francophonisation"" of their regions. On October 2017, 1, several dozens of protesters - considered ""criminals being manipulated"" by the authorities - were shot dead. Once again the ""Self-Defence"" has been explained by the regime.

After a year of continuous repression, of self-silence of the international community, cameroonian speakers, minority speakers, decided to take the maquis and weapons to fight Paul Biya's regime and to tackle the forces of order and symbols of The State. Today, these English-speaking regions of North-West and South-West Cameroon have turned into a low-intensity conflict, where abuse is committed by all parties to the conflict.

"" all this is an immense waste. Instead of developing harmoniously the country and especially the surrounding regions, Paul Biya's regime has been fighting over the last decade to strengthen its hold over the country, especially through the repression of any protest, for the sole purpose of keeping itself in power and The International Community has been passive "" says cl√©ment boursin, Africa manager at the

Ten years after the bloody repression in camera of February 2008, the finding is bitter.

"THE JEWS OF CAMEROON

The African-American actor, Yaphet Kotto, was a Cameroonian-American Jew. In fact, about one percent of the West African country of Cameroon is Jewish. At least five tribes -- the Bassa (Ba-Saa), Bamileke, Douala, Mboo, and Eton -- appear to have Jewish origins.

Some Igbo (Ibo), who live mainly in Nigeria, are also found in Cameroon.

The Cameroonian Rabbi Yisrael Oriel reports that he was born into the Ba-Saa tribe. He says there were historically Jews in the area and that the word ""Ba-Saa"" is from the Hebrew for 'on a journey' (ba‚Äôsa‚Äôah).

Rabbi Oriel reports that he is a Levite descended from Moses, made aliya in 1988, was ordained as a rabbi by the Sephardic Chief Rabbi, and was appointed rabbi to Nigerian Jews.

Rabbi Oriel claims that in 1920, Cameroon had 400,000 'Israelites' in, but by 1962 the number had decreased to 167,000 due to conversion to Christianity and Islam. He says that although these tribes were not accepted halachically, he believes that he can prove their Jewish status from medieval rabbinic sources.

Rabbi Oriel reports that his grandmother was a Sabbath observer, and she lit candles on Friday evenings. When Oriel, who was raised in Cameroon, traveled to Europe for advanced academic studies, he discovered that these observances were Jewish in origin and decided to convert and became a rabbi.

Serge Etele, a Cameroonian Jew, reports: ‚Äúbefore I read Rabbi Oriel‚Äôs article, I had not given much credence to claims by local tribes of their Jewish origins... What I did know was that many local tribes‚Ä¶had once observed rituals and customs similar to Jewish ones. The timeline of these observances put them before the arrival of Christian missionaries, who had discouraged them.

‚ÄúI can remember from my own childhood that we did not eat the animals that are forbidden in the Bible, and we practiced circumcision, definitely not a Christian custom. We also practiced halitzah, where a man marries the wife of his deceased brother or relative, to ensure that a child is born to the widow and that he husband‚Äôs name is not lost. The custom is no longer practiced.

Possible sources of Jews in Cameroon include the following:

o Yemenite/Ethiopian Jews: based on their observance of only the holidays mentioned in Torah, perhaps the Cameroon Jewish community dates back to the time, possibly 2,600 ‚Äì 2,900 years ago, that the Yemenite Jews crossed over the narrows of the Red Sea to Ethiopia.

Most of those Yemenite/Ethiopian Israelites remained in Ethiopia, but some may have gone west, through the Bilad al-Sudan (see below), where many Jews lived, and on to Nigeria, before the time of the Talmud and its post-Torah holidays.

o The African-Jewish communities of the Bilad al-Sudan ( ◊ë÷¥÷º◊ú÷∑◊ì÷º ◊ê÷∑◊ú ◊°◊ï÷º◊ì÷∏÷º◊ê÷∑◊ü, West African Jews of what is now Ghana, Mali, and the Songhai Empire, which existed from the sixth to the nineteenth centuries, for hundreds of miles on both sides of the Niger river, where many Jews lived, and where local Mali legends record the first Jewish presence in West Africa).

o The Berber Jews of southern Morocco and southern Algeria (such as the group called Iddao Ishaak [Isaac]), who traveled south both to trade and to escape Islamic invasions of North Africa in the seventh and eighth centuries C.E.).

o The Spanish and Portuguese Jews (fleeing persecution by the Catholic armies that completed their reconquest of Spain and Portugal in 1492-1494).

o The Moroccan and Algerian Sephardic traders, who themselves, or their ancestors, had come from Spain and Portugal, and who had a fairly direct sea route from the Mediterranean, east through the Strait of Gibraltar, and south along Africa‚Äôs Atlantic coast, to Ghana, a populous trading center.

o The relatively nearby Jewish communities of Ghana and Nigeria.",Highly-Offensive

"South West toughens stance on Anglophone crisis

Demand more troops to counter rising separatist incursions

Some Elites of the South West region, majority from CPDM, have called on the government to increase the number of troops fighting in the region. The request according to them is to secure the socio-economic and political life of the region, currently experiencing dwindling fortune.

The call was made at the Buea Mountain hotel conference room Saturday during the South West forum, held on the theme, ìThe South West Region, Facing Our Challenges Together.î

During the in camera meeting, the Elites said there have been remarkable progress in the region in domains like, infrastructure such as; road construction, stadia, hotels, hospitals among others.

They also said a lot has been done in improving standards and numbers in secondary and tertiary institutions.

They however lamented that these progress has witness setbacks in the past two years as results of the Anglophone crisis because ÖThere have been burning of educational and health structures through violence, prevention of students and teachers from attending classes, frustration of construction works, disruption of activities of Cameroon Development Corporation, CDC, Pamol plantations, killing, maiming, abductions of chiefs, businessmen and women, civil servants, security men, desecration of shrines, burning and looting of chief palaces by armed men who are hiding in bushes and causing terror.

Attendees at the South West Forum resolved as follows:

Called on sons and daughters of the region to realize the harm inflicted on their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters and stop all activities that will disturb the peace of the region.

Called on all those fighting to lay down arms, leave bushes and forest and regain their homes and live as South Westerners.

Called on all those not from South West to desist from using the region as area of wicked acts (battle ground), to lay down arms and live peacefully with the people of the region.

Called on the Population of South West to send children back to school and not to heed to fear.
Called on the people to constitute vigilante groups supported by State and say no to bully of misguided terrorists.

Say no to impoverishment of region and protect economic institutions under supervision of the State.

Exhort those in Diaspora to transcend passion and allow reason to prevail.

At the end of the meeting, the Elites said at no time did they ever ask for Federalism or Secession. They maintained that Cameroon remains one, indivisible and a decentralize nation.

They also urged the government to increase the number of forces in the region to maintain peace.

This forum, almost a replica of the August 23, 1993 meeting held between South West Chiefs and Elites, did not condemn killings and atrocities committed by the military but ironically called on more troops into the region.

The tone of the final decision speaks volume;

All those perpetrating violence are not from the South West.

All the killings have been done by Ambazonia fighters

Strangers, though they did not want to use ìCam No Goî and or ìGraffiî, are the ones retarding the development of the region.

They are a separate region and have nothing to do with North West region (though not mentioned)

Despite the crisis and the ills of the government, they are happy and that Federalism cannot be compared with the most cherished decentralization, talk less of secession",Neutral
